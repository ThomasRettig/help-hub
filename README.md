# HopeHub

HelpHub is a Discord bot which detects indicators of possible suicidal ideation in messages by matching them to our database of suicidal words.

## Ideas
- Send a message to the sender with mental health support links
- Customise message by mentioning username of sender
- Include a randomly selected quote on mental health in order to make the message more “personalised”
